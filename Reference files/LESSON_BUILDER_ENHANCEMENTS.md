## Lesson Completion & Scoring System

### Score Components

The lesson scoring system evaluates student performance across multiple dimensions:

**Activity Score (Base Score + Conditions)**

- **Base Score**: Starting score (typically 70 points)
- **Positive Condition Bonuses**: Points added for meeting beneficial conditions (default: +5 per condition)
- **Negative Condition Penalties**: Points subtracted for triggering warning conditions (default: -3 per condition)

**Quiz Integration**

- **Quiz Weight**: Percentage of final score from quiz results (default: 30%)
- **Activity Weight**: Remaining percentage from condition-based activity (default: 70%)

### Real-Time Tracking

The system tracks student progress throughout the lesson:

```javascript
// Example condition tracking
lessonTracker.recordPositiveCondition("savings_goal_met", { amount: 500 });
lessonTracker.recordNegativeCondition("budget_negative", { deficit: -150 });
lessonTracker.addQuizScore(85, 100, "Budget Planning Quiz");
```

### Completion Configuration

Teachers can customize lesson completion parameters:

- **Completion Message**: Personalized success message
- **Base Score**: Starting score before bonuses/penalties
- **Condition Weights**: Impact of positive/negative conditions
- **Quiz Integration**: How much quizzes contribute to final score

### Grade Calculation Example

```
Student Activity:
- Base Score: 70 points
- Met 3 positive conditions: +15 points (3 × 5)
- Triggered 1 negative condition: -3 points (1 × 3)
- Activity Score: 82/100

Quiz Performance:
- Quiz 1: 90/100
- Quiz 2: 75/100
- Average Quiz Score: 82.5/100

Final Calculation:
- Activity Component: 82 × 70% = 57.4 points
- Quiz Component: 82.5 × 30% = 24.75 points
- Final Score: 82.15 points (B+ grade)
```
